        <h1>Peace</h1>
        <p>
            Peace is a state of harmony and mutual understanding, where individuals, communities, and nations coexist without conflict or hostility. 
            It is more than just the absence of war or violence; peace involves respect, justice, and compassion that lead to an environment where people can thrive. 
            When we pursue peace, we aim to build a world where everyone feels safe, valued, and able to express themselves freely. True peace begins from within, as we cultivate empathy, kindness, and patience in our daily lives.
        </p>

                <h2>Peace Logo</h2>
                <p>
                    The peace symbol, often recognized as a circular logo with an inverted V-shape and two lines extending down, was originally designed in 1958 for the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. 
                    Over time, it has become an iconic representation of peace movements worldwide. The symbol resonates with the idea of nonviolence and unity, reflecting the desire to end conflict and promote harmony among all.

        <p>
            Achieving peace is a collective effort, requiring the participation of individuals, communities, and nations. It means standing up for equality, justice, and human rights while fostering understanding and cooperation. 
            Through education, dialogue, and empathy, we can all play a part in building a peaceful world.
